transcr. into ft3, and mei by Irina Döring

The piece has no barlines. Added them in accordance with the concordance in D-Mbs Mus.ms. 1512, fol. 45v (two semibreves par measure). made the barlines invisible in the diplomatic transcription.
This is different in the transcription by Flotzinger (Flotzinger, Rudolf. 1971. *Das Lautenbüchlein des Jakob Thurner*. Musik Alter Meister 27. Akademische Druck- und Verlagsanstalt). There, the measures contain 4 semibreves.

Fol. 8r, system 1, third last single note, it looks like the scribe first wrote a "1" and replaced it with a "p". "p" is in accordance with the same run in the concordance in D-Mbs Mus.ms. 1512, fol. 45v.
Indicated with '<del>'-tag in the diplomatic transcription. 

Fol. 8r, system 3, second dyad, there seems to be an "o" in the upper and in the lower voice, and the scribe crossed through the upper one.
Indicated with '<del>'-tag in the diplomatic transcription. 

Fol. 8r, system 3, last semibrevis, it looks like the scribe added a "c". 
This would be dissonant, however, and, we are in a two voice texture, where it would be strange to add a third voice for just one chord. 
Therefore, and because otherwise there is one note missing, I think that this is rhather kind of graphic than a tablature sign; a half round that means that the "9" and the "1" are meant to be played after another and not at the same time.
Not yet indicated in mei.
